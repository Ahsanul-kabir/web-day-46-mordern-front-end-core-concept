What is single page application and its benefits?

Ans : A single-page application works in the browser and requires
no page reloads and no extra time for waiting. The page doesn't need
to be updated since content is downloaded automatically.
We use these types of applications every day. Just think of Facebook or Trello.
These are excellent examples of single-page apps.
